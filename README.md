## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the second thing that I've written using grid for the layout so I found it useful to practice. I still like flex way more but I'll get used to grid. I'm also really glad that I was able to stick with mobile first design on this.

### Useful resources

- [Josh Comeau's Interactive Guide to CSS Grid](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/): This was a great refresher. All of his guidese are amazing.
